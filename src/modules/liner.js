What is the _lastLineData stuff all about? 
We donâ€™t want a chunk of data to get cut off in the middle of a line.  
In order to avoid that, we splice out the last line we find so it does not push to the consumer.  
When a new chunk comes in we prepend the line data to the front and continue.  
This way we can safeguard against half lines being pushed out.

We push out the _lastLineData provided if we have some to the consumer and 
then cleanup our instance variable.  
Finally, we call callback() to signal that we are finished flushing.

Remember, the _flush method is optional and may be unnecessary for some Transform streams.
